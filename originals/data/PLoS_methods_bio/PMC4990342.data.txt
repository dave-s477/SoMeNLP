We analyzed data on age , sex , and drug use in 1 346 709 elderly persons aged ≥ 65 years registered in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register ( SPDR ) in July to September 2008 .
The SPDR contains information about all prescription drugs dispensed at Swedish pharmacies to the entire Swedish population ( about 9 million inhabitants ) [22] .
Via record linkage to the Swedish Social Services Register , we also retrieved information about type of housing ( i.e. home dwelling / institution ) .
Since 2007 , all Swedish municipalities report individual - based information of institutional care to this register [23] .
Almost all institutional care in Sweden is organized and granted by the municipalities .
We calculated a 1 - day point prevalence for drug use on the arbitrarily chosen date of September 30 , 2008 .
The method for the calculations has been described in detail elsewhere [24] .
Briefly , since prescription drugs are dispensed for at most 3 months in Sweden , we used information about when the prescription was filled , the amount of drugs dispensed and prescribed dosage , from the preceding 3 months to calculate the 1 - day point prevalence .
If the same drug was dispensed more than once during the 3 month period , it was calculated as one drug .
The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC ) classification system was used for classification of drugs , as recommended by the Word Health Organization [25] .
APD usage , defined as use of any dopaminergic anti - Parkinson drug in ATC - class N04B ( i.e. Dopa and dopa derivatives ( ATC - code N04B A ) , adamantane derivatives ( N04B B ) , dopamine agonists ( N04B C ) , monoamine oxidase B inhibitors ( N04B D ) and other dopaminergic agents ( N04B X ) ) was used as a proxy for PD [26] .
The following drug classes that may increase the risk of falls in old people ( i.e. FRIDs ) were analyzed : opioids ( ATC - code N02A ) , antipsychotics ( N05A ( N05A N excluded ) ) , anxiolytics ( N05B ) , hypnotics and sedatives ( N05C ) , antidepressants ( N06A ) , vasodilators used in cardiac diseases ( C01D ) , antihypertensives ( C02 ) , diuretics ( C03 ) , beta - blocking agents ( C07 ) , calcium channel blockers ( C08 ) , agents acting on the renin - angiotensin system ( C09 ) , alpha - adrenoreceptor antagonists ( G04C A ) , dopaminergic anti - parkinson drugs ( N04B ) [27] and anticholinergic drugs [19] .
We used a list of anticholinergic drugs published by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare : anticholinergic drugs for functional gastrointestinal disorders ( A03A B , A03B A , A03B B ) , anticholinergic antiemetics ( A04A D ) , antiarrhythmic s ( C01B A ) , drugs for urinary frequency and incontinence ( G04B D ) , opioids in combination with antispasmodics ( N02A G ) , anticholinergic anti - parkinson drugs ( N04A ) , some antipsychotics ( N05A A , N05A F03 , N05A H02 ) , hydroxyzine ( N05B B01 ) , non - selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors ( N06A A ) and certain antihistamines ( R 06AA 02 , R 06AB , R 06AD , R 06AX 02 ) [27] .
Hence , the use of any FRIDs in this study refer to the use of at least one drug in the above mentioned drug classes with the exception of anti - parkinson drugs in ATC class N04A and N04B , since we chose to analyze these drugs separately .
The concomitant use of several FRIDs refer to the total number of used drugs in the ATC classes defined above , i.e. it can be drugs from different ATC classes or different drugs from the same ATC class .
The use of specific FRIDs refer to the use of at least one drug in the respective ATC classes described above .
The use of any anticholinergics refers to use of any of the anticholinergics listed above ( ATC class N04A excluded ) .
We also investigated the use of osteoporosis drugs ( use of drugs in ATC classes A12A X , G03X C01 , M05B A or M05B B ) , and polypharmacy , defined as use of ≥ 5 drugs simultaneously .
The type of housing variable was defined as home - dwelling ( living in own home ) or institutionalized ( e.g. nursing - home , sheltered accommodation ) [24] .
We performed both crude and multivariate logistic regression analysis in order to study whether use of APD was associated with use of FRIDS .
In model 1 , adjustment was made for age ( continuous variable ) and sex .
In model 2 , additional adjustment was made for type of housing .
The results are presented as odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals .
SPSS 22.0 for Windows ( SPSS Inc . , Chicago , IL ) was used for the analyses .
The study was approved by the regional ethical review board in Stockholm ( Dnr 2009 / 477 - 31 / 3 ) .
Only de - identified register - based data were used .
