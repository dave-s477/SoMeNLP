Introduction
MicroRNA ( miRNA or miR ) is a class of non - coding RNA with 14 - 24 nucleotides [1] .
It is reported that abnormal expression of miRNA is associated with tumorigenesis [1-3] .
Some miRNA molecules can induce tumorigenesis and promote tumor progression as tumor promoters ; on the other hand , some miRNA molecules act as tumor suppressors and inhibit the growth of tumor cells or induce their apoptosis .
Therefore , miRNA molecules are considered as novel tumor markers and can be used in the diagnosis , treatment and prognosis prediction of tumors [4] .
However , one miRNA molecule often has multiple target genes with similar or opposite functions , and the regulatory effects of a miRNA molecule on cell growth are related to many factors , such as cell type [5] .
Therefore , in order to promote the application of miRNA in cancer diagnosis , treatment and prognosis prediction , it is of great importance to fully understand the targets and regulatory mechanisms of miRNA .
miR - 497 - 5p belongs to miR - 15 family and is coded by the first intron of MIR 497HG gene ( ID : 100506755 ) on human chromosome 17p 13.1 .
The expression of miR - 497 - 5p is extensive in vivo , and its expression level is closely related to disease development .
It is shown that miR - 497 - 5p can promote the differentiation of lung - resident mesenchymal stem cells into myofibroblasts and the formation of pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting the expression of Reck gene [6] .
Increased expression of miR - 497 - 5p results in decreased insulin receptor content and induces insulin resistance in HFD - MES rats [7] .
In addition , changes in the expression of miR - 497 - 5p are related to the occurrence and development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma , non - small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma [8-10] .
The regulation of miR - 497 - 5p on glioma cell growth may be different and may be acted through different mechanisms .
For example , Xi et al reported that miR - 497 - 5p targeted and bound with Nrdp 1 to promote the proliferation of human glioma U87 cells [11] .
Low expression of miR - 497 - 5p enhanced growth inhibition and apoptosis of glioma cells induced by TMZ [12] , however , Zhao et al demonstrated that miR - 497 - 5p expression decreased glioma cell growth and invasion both in vitro and in vivo through Wnt3a / c - Jun feedback regulation [13] .
Different from glioma , the function of miR - 497 - 5p in other tumors is growth inhibition .
For example , miR - 497 - 5p can target YAP 1 to inhibit the proliferation , invasion and migration of thyroid papillary carcinoma and non - small cell lung cancer [14,15] and induce cycle arrest and apoptosis of breast cancer , gastric cancer , lung cancer and cervical cancer by regulating the expression of Bcl - w , Bcl - 2 , CDK 6 or Cyclin E1 [16-19] .
These effects of miR - 497 - 5p make it a potential marker for tumor diagnosis , treatment and prognosis [20-23] .
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignant tumor in the world in terms of morbidity and mortality [24] .
It has been reported that miR - 497 - 5p is differently expressed in cervical cancer , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and normal tissues , and it can be used in the clinical diagnosis of cervical cancer [21] .
By targeting insulin - like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF - 1R ) and transketolase ( TKT ) , miR - 497 - 5p inhibits cell invasion , migration , and drug resistance of the cervical cancer cells [25,26] .
Our previous study has also shown that miR - 497 - 5p can target Cyclin E1 to arrest cell cycle of cervical cancer cells [19] .
However , it still remains unclear whether miR - 497 - 5p can regulate the growth of cervical cancer cells through other mechanisms .
In the present study , we investigated the mechanism by which miR - 497 - 5p regulates the growth of cervical cancer cells , in order to promote the application of miR - 497 - 5p in the diagnosis , treatment and prognosis of cervical cancer .

Down - Regulation Of CBX 4 Expression Inhibits The Proliferation Of Cervical Cancer Cells By Arresting The Cells In S Phase And Reducing The Expression Of CDK 2 And Cyclin A2 Proteins
To inhibit CBX 4 expression in cervical cancer cells , two interference RNAs of CBX 4 , ie SiCBX 4 - 1and SiCBX 4 - 2 , were synthesized .
The data showed that CBX 4 expression in cells transfected with SiCBX 4 - 1 or SiCBX 4 - 2 was significantly lower than that in the negative control group , and the inhibitory rate of SiCBX 4 - 1 was higher than that of SiCBX 4 - 2 ( Figure 3A - C ) .
To test the effect of the inhibition of CBX 4 expression on cervical cancer cell growth , MTT assay was conducted .

miR - 497 - 5p Is Involved In The Regulation Of Cervical Cancer Cell Proliferation Through Regulating CBX 4 - CDK 2 / Cyclin A2 Expression
To test whether miR - 497 - 5p regulates cervical cancer cells growth by regulating CBX 4 - CDK 2 / Cyclin A2 expression , we suppressed miR - 497 - 5p expression by miR - 497 - 5p inhibitor ( miR - 497 - in ) , and silenced CBX 4 expression by CBX 4 interference RNAs ( SiCBX 4 - 1 ) , at the same time .
The data showed that suppression of miR - 497 - 5p elevated CBX 4 expression when compared with the control group ( miR - 497 - inNC + NC ) ( Figure 4A ) .
In addition , CBX 4 expression in cells with both miR - 497 - 5p inhibitor and CBX 4 interference RNAs ( miR - 497 - in + SiCBX 4 - 1 group ) was decreased when compared with the control group ( miR - 497 - inNC + NC ) , suggesting that silenced expression of CBX 4 neutralized miR - 497 - 5p inhibitor induced up - regulation of CBX 4 ( Figure 4B ) .
MTT assay showed that , 48 hrs later after cell transfection , the proliferation of Siha and HeLa cells with the miR - 497 - 5p inhibitor ( miR - 497 - in ) was elevated , those with the CBX 4 interference RNAs ( SiCBX 4 - 1 ) was reduced , and the proliferation of Siha and HeLa cells with both miR - 497 - 5p inhibitor and CBX 4 interference RNAs , miR - 497 - in + SiCBX 4 - 1 group , was also decreased ( Figure 4C ) .
Flow cytometry showed that inhibition of miR - 497 - 5p elevated the number of S - phase Siha and HeLa cells , silencing of CBX 4 increased the number of S - phase Siha and HeLa cells , and the increase in the number of S - phase Siha and HeLa cells with inhibition of miR - 497 - 5p was decreased by silencing of CBX 4 ( Figure 4D ) .
Western blotting showed that the silencing of CBX 4 reduced the content of CDK 2 and Cyclin A2 proteins , and inhibition of miR - 497 - 5p and silencing of CBX 4 at the same time also decreased the expression of CDK 2 and Cyclin A2 proteins ( Figure 4E ) .
These results indicate that miR - 497 - 5p may regulate cervical cancer cell proliferation through regulating CBX 4 , CDK 2 and Cyclin A2 expression .
Discussion
CBX 4 , also known as hPC 2 or NBP 16 , is a member of the polycomb protein family with SUMO E3 ligase activity .
In cell growth , CBX 4 can regulate DNA modification , stability and terminal repair through SUMOylation of Dnmt 3 , BMl 1 and Ctlp [27] , - [29] and is possibly related to the maintenance of DNA replication and integrity .
It is reported that CBX 4 gene expression can promote the growth of breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma cells , and it is a potential tumor growth promoter [30-32] .
Our data showed that reducing the expression of CBX 4 gene inhibited the proliferation of Siha and HeLa cells and arrested the cell cycle in S phase .
Western blotting confirmed that the expression of CDK 2 and Cyclin A2 protein was down - regulated , demonstrating that CBX 4 down - regulation inhibits the cell cycle of cervical cancer cells , as well as their proliferation .
This result is consistent with the promoting effect of CBX 4 on the growth of breast cancer and liver cancer , suggesting that CBX 4 may be a therapeutic target for breast cancer , liver cancer and cervical cancer [33] .
In addition , RNA interference of CBX 4 arrested Siha and HeLa cells at S phase , indicating that CBX 4 has a positive regulatory effect on S / G2 transition of cervical cancer cells , which is consistent with the regulatory effects of CBX 4 on DNA modification , stability and terminal repair .
miR - 497 - 5p can target CBX 4 to inhibit the proliferation of cervical cancer cells .
When treating cervical cancer cells with miR - 497 - 5p inhibitor , we found that CBX 4 gene expression was increased , cell proliferation rate of cervical cancer cells was elevated , and cell cycle was arrested at S - phase , which is consistent with the regulatory effect of miR - 497 - 5p on the cell cycle of ALK - positive cells , melanoma cells and 293T cells [34-36] .
However , inhibition of miR - 497 - 5p together with down - regulation of CBX 4 resulted in decreased proliferation of cervical cancer cells .
The number of S - phase cells in this group was lower than that of cells with inhibition of miR - 497 - 5p , and higher than that of control group , suggesting that CBX 4 is a key molecule in the regulation of the growth of cervical cancer cells by miR - 497 - 5p , and changes in CBX 4 expression directly affect the proliferation of cervical cancer cells .
This study has some limitations .
First , the sample size of normal tissue from the TCGA database was small .
Second , the correlation between miR - 497 - 5p and CBX 4 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma was weak .
Further studies are warranted .
In conclusion , the present study demonstrates that miR - 497 - 5p affects the cell cycle of cervical cancer cells by targeting CBX 4 , and thus inhibits the proliferation of cervical cancer cells .
This study provides help in understanding the mechanism by which miR - 497 - 5p regulates the proliferation of cervical cancer cells .
