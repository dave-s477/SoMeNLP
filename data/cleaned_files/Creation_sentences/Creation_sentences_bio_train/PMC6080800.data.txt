Here , we introduce PyPhi , a Python software package that implements this framework for causal analysis and unfolds the full cause - effect structure of discrete dynamical systems of binary elements .
PyPhi is open - source and licensed under the GPLv 3 ; the source code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi .
Here we describe PyPhi , a Python software package that implements IIT ’ s framework for causal analysis and unfolds the full CES of discrete Markovian dynamical systems of binary elements .
